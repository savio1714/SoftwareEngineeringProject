			<h1>Dichlorvos</h1>    
				<p>Dichlorvos is used to control household, public health, and stored product insects. It is effective against mushroom flies, aphids, spider mites, caterpillars, thrips, and white flies in greenhouse, outdoor fruit, and vegetable crops. Therapeutically, dichlorvos is used to treat a variety of parasitic worm infections in dogs, livestock and humans. Dichlorvos can be fed to livestock to control botfly larvae in the manure. It acts against insects as both a contact and a stomach poison. Dichlorvos is available in aerosol and soluble concentrate formulations. It is used as a fumigant and has been used to make pet collars and pest strips.</p>
				<p>Dichlorvos is one of a class of insecticides referred to as organophosphates. These chemicals act by interfering with the activities of cholinesterase, an enzyme that is essential for the proper working of the nervous systems of both humans and insects. Please refer to the Toxicology Information Brief on cholinesterase-inhibition for a more detailed description of this topic.</p>
				<p>In 1955, it was discovered that crystalline trichlorfon, another organophosphate pesticide, gave off a vapor which was capable of killing insects. That vapor was dichlorvos, which has since been developed for insect control in enclosed spaces.</p>
			<h2>TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS</h2>
				<h3>ACUTE TOXICITY</h3>
					<p>Dichlorvos is highly toxic by inhalation, dermal absorption and ingestion. Because dichlorvos is volatile, inhalation is the most common route of exposure. As with all organophosphates, dichlorvos is readily absorbed through the skin. Skin which has come in contact with this material should be washed immediately with soap and water and all contaminated clothing should be removed.</p>
					<p>Acute illness from dichlorvos is limited to the effects of cholinesterase inhibition. Compared to poisoning by other organophosphates, dichlorvos causes a more rapid onset of symptoms, which is often followed by a similarly rapid recovery. This occurs because dichlorvos is rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body. Persons with reduced pulmonary (lung) function, convulsive disorders, liver disorders, or recent exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors will be at increased risk from exposure to dichlorvos. Alcoholic beverages may enhance the toxic effects of dichlorvos. High environmental temperatures or exposure of dichlorvos to visible or UV light may enhance its toxicity.</p>
					<p>Dichlorvos is mildly irritating to skin. Concentrates of dichlorvos may cause burning sensations, or actual burns. Dichlorvos can be very toxic if it is not immediately washed off, but instead left on the skin long enough for it to become absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream. One man nearly died after spilling 4 ounces of a 3% oil solution of dichlorvos on his lap. He did not wash it off. Another man only became nauseous and dizzy after spilling a similar amount on his arm. He washed off the dichlorvos with soap and water. Do not use organic solvents to remove dichlorvos from the skin (DLA/DOD Hazardous Mat'ls Info. System #0014-29- 438-0000. 1982).</p>
					<p>The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath, and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction, and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the eye pupils, tears, salivation, sweating, and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue, involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beats, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Death may be caused by respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.</p>
				<h3>CHRONIC TOXICITY</h3>
					<p>Feeding studies indicate that a dosage of dichlorvos very much larger than doses which inhibit cholinesterase are needed to produce illness. Rats tolerated dietary doses as high as 62.5 mg/kg/day for 90 days with no visible signs of illness, while a dietary level of 0.25 mg/kg/day for only 4 days produced a reduction in cholinesterase levels.</p>
					<p>Rats were exposed to air concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg/m3 of dichlorvos over a 5 week period. Rats in the 0.5 and 5 mg/kg groups exhibited significantly decreased cholinesterase activity in the plasma, red blood cells, and brain. The NOEL for this study was 0.05 mg/m3. In dogs fed dietary doses of 0.0095, 0.016, 0.16, 1.6 or 12.5 mg/kg/day for 2 years, decreased red blood cell cholinesterase activity, increased liver weights and increased liver cell size occurred in the two highest doses tested. The NOEL was 0.08 mg/kg/day. Chronic exposure to dichlorvos will cause fluid to build up in the lungs (pulmonary edema) (NIH/EPA; OHM/TADS 1984).</p>
					<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to organophosphates may result in the same effects as acute exposure including the delayed symptoms. Other effects reported in workers repeatedly exposed include impaired memory and concentration, disorientation, severe depressions, irritability, confusion, headache, speech difficulties, delayed reaction times, nightmares, sleepwalking and drowsiness or insomnia. An influenza-like condition with headache, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, and malaise has also been reported.</p>
				<h3>Reproductive Effects</h3>
					<p>When male and female rats were given a diet containing 100 ppm (5 mg/kg/day) dichlorvos just before mating, and with this dosage continued through pregnancy and lactation for females, there were no effects on reproduction or on the survival or growth of the offspring, even though severe cholinesterase inhibition occurred in the mothers and significant inhibition occurred in the offspring. The same results were observed in a 3-generation study with rats fed dietary levels up to (25 mg/kg/day). Once in the bloodstream, dichlorvos may cross the placenta.</p>
				<h3>Teratogenic Effects</h3>
					<p>A dose of 12 mg/kg was not teratogenic in rabbits and did not interfere with reproduction in any way. There was no evidence of teratogenicity when rats and rabbits were exposed to air concentrations of up to 6.25 mg/m3 throughout pregnancy. Dichlorvos was not teratogenic when given orally to rats.</p>
				<h3>Mutagenic Effects</h3>
					<p>Dichlorvos can bind to molecules such as DNA. For this reason, there has been extensive testing of dichlorvos for mutagenicity. Several studies reviewed by EPA have shown dichlorvos to be a mutagen. Dichlorvos is reported positive in the Ames mutagenicity assay (Mut. Res. 87:211 (1981); 76:169 (1980); 40 (1):19 (1976) and in other tests involving bacterial or animal cell cultures. However no evidence of mutagenicity has been found in tests performed on live animals. Its lack of mutagenicity in live animals may be due to rapid metabolism and excretion of dichlorvos.</p>
